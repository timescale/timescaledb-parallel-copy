# Security Policy

We aim to keep **timescaledb-parallel-copy** safe for everyone.  Publicly disclosing security bugs in a public forum can put everyone in the Timescale community at risk, however. Therefore, we ask that people follow the below instructions to report security vulnerability.  The entire Timescale community thanks you!

## Supported Versions

The supported version is always the latest major release available in our repository.  We also release regular minor versions with fixes and corrections alongside some new features as well as patchfix releases, that you should keep upgrading to.  Vulnerability fixes are made available as part of these patchfix releases and you can read our list of [Security Advisories](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-parallel-copy/security/advisories).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in our software, please email the [Timescale Security Team](https://www.timescale.com/.well_known/security.txt) at security@timescale.com.

Please note that the e-mail address should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Timescale products and services.  Regular bug reports should be submitted as GitHub issues, while other _questions_ around security, compliance, or functionality can be made either through our support (for customers) or community channels (e.g., [Timescale Slack](https://slack.timescale.com/), [Forums](https://www.timescale.com/forums), etc.)
